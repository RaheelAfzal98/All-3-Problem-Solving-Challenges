# 🧩 Assignment 3: Python Logic Practice

This repository contains a small Python project designed to sharpen basic problem-solving skills through fun, practical coding challenges. These exercises are part of my ongoing journey in learning Python with real-world logic-building examples.

## 📄 Overview

In this mini assignment, I’ve tackled three fundamental Python problems that focus on strings and number manipulation:

- 🔁 Reversing a String  
- 🔤 Counting Vowels in a String  
- 🔢 Calculating the Sum of Digits in a Number  

The code is written with simplicity in mind, making it accessible for beginners who are getting comfortable with core Python concepts.
