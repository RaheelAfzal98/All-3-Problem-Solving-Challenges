🧩 Assignment 3: Python Logic Practice

This repository contains a small Python project designed to sharpen basic problem-solving skills through fun, practical coding challenges. These exercises are part of my ongoing journey in learning Python with real-world logic-building examples.

📄 Overview
In this mini assignment, I’ve tackled three fundamental Python problems that focus on strings and number manipulation:

Reversing a String

Counting Vowels in a String

Calculating the Sum of Digits in a Number

The code is written with simplicity in mind, making it accessible for beginners who are getting comfortable with core Python concepts.

💻 Getting Started
To run the scripts locally on your machine:

Make sure Python is installed on your system.

Clone this repository or download the .py files.

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the project folder.

Run any file using the command: python filename.py

📚 Key Concepts Covered

String slicing and manipulation

Conditional statements and loops

Defining and using functions

Writing clean, readable, and beginner-friendly Python code
